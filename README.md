# Chat with green api

## Short description

This is a simple chat application with a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages through WhatsApp using the [green api](https://green-api.com). The client communicates with the server through HTTP requests. To retrieve messages, a request needs to be made. More details about the API's functionality can be found at the following link: [green doc](https://green-api.com/docs/api/).

To get started with the application, you need to follow the [green account](https://green-api.com/docs/before-start/#cabinet), register, and obtain a token and instance.
